        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">MidnightMics Content Tool</p>

        <h2>1. Overview</h2>
        <p>MidnightMics Content Tool is a personal content management application used by the creator behind <strong>@midnightmics</strong> on TikTok. This privacy policy explains what data the tool handles and how it is stored.</p>
        <p>This is a personal tool operated by a single individual. It is not a public service, and it does not have external users.</p>

        <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>This tool collects and stores the minimum data necessary to function:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>TikTok OAuth tokens</strong> — Used to authenticate with TikTok's API and publish content to the @midnightmics account. These tokens are obtained through TikTok's official OAuth authorization flow.</li>
            <li><strong>Basic account information</strong> — Limited profile information (such as username and account ID) returned by TikTok during the OAuth process, used solely to confirm the correct account is connected.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>That is the full extent of data collection. The tool does not collect analytics, usage data, cookies, IP addresses, or any other personal information.</p>

        <h2>3. How Data Is Used</h2>
        <p>All collected data is used exclusively for one purpose: publishing video content to the connected TikTok account via the TikTok Developer API. Data is never used for advertising, profiling, analytics, or any other secondary purpose.</p>

        <h2>4. Data Storage and Security</h2>
        <p>OAuth tokens and account information are stored on a private, access-controlled server operated by the tool's owner. Specifically:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Tokens are stored in encrypted or access-restricted configuration files</li>
            <li>The server is not publicly accessible</li>
            <li>Access is limited to the tool's owner</li>
            <li>No cloud databases or third-party storage services are used for sensitive credentials</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Sharing</h2>
        <p>Data is <strong>never</strong> shared with, sold to, or disclosed to any third party. The only external service the tool communicates with is the TikTok API, as required to publish content.</p>

        <h2>6. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>OAuth tokens are retained only as long as they are needed to operate the tool. Tokens can be revoked at any time through TikTok's account settings, which immediately removes this tool's access.</p>

        <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>This tool is not a public-facing service and does not collect data from any users, including children. It has no user registration, no public interface, and no mechanism for anyone other than its owner to interact with it.</p>

        <h2>8. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since this tool is operated by and for a single individual (the account owner), traditional data subject rights (access, deletion, portability) are exercised directly by the owner through server access and TikTok account settings.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>This policy may be updated if the tool's functionality changes. Updates will be reflected on this page with a revised date.</p>

        <h2>10. Contact</h2>
        <p>For questions about this privacy policy or the tool's data practices, contact: <strong>midnightmics [at] proton [dot] me</strong></p>
